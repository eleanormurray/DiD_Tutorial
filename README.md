# DiD_Tutorial
A tutorial on the implementation of difference-in-difference (DiD) analyses using regression for estimating the effect of a group-level treatment among the treated in biomedical research.

Synthetic datasets are available as SAS files (.sas7bdat), as Stata files (.dta), and as a CSV file. In addition, the code for creating the synthetic data is available in SAS. Analytic code is available in SAS, Stata, and R. Note that the SAS code uses non-parametric bootstrapping to obtain valid, non-conservative confidence intervals. The Stata & R code use robust variance estimation which provides valid, but conservative (i.e., wider than 95%) confidence intervals.
 
The Tutorial Workbook is available as a Student Version (no solutions) and a Teacher Version (solutions). This repository accompanies a tutorial article on DiD available at: [tbd].
